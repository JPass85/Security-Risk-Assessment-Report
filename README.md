### Part 1 : Hardening tools and methods to implement
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   
   - MFA requires users to employ multiple methods to identify and verify their credentials before accessing an application. Various MFA methods include fingerprint scans, ID cards, PIN numbers, and passwords

2. Setting and enforcing strong password policies

   - Password policies can be refined to incorporate rules concerning passwword length, acceptable characters, and disclaimers discouraging password sharing. Additionally, they can encompass regulations regarding unsuccessful attempts.
  
 3. Perform firewall maintaince regularly

    - Maintaining the firewall involves regular checks and updates to security configurations to stay ahead of potential threats.

### Part 2 : Explanation 
1. Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) decreases the probability of a malicious actor gaining access to a network through brute force or related attacks. Additionally, MFA complicates the sharing of passwords among individuals within the organization. The identification and verification of credentials are particularly crucial for employees with administrative level privileges on the network. Regular enforcement of MFA is imperative.

2. Establishing and implementing a password policy within the company will heighten the difficulty for malicious actors attempting to access the network. The rules outlined in the password policy must be consistently enforced within the organization to enhance user security.

3. Regular maintenance of the firewall is essential. Firewall rules should be promptly updated whenever a security event occurs, particularly events that permit suspicious network traffic into the network. This proactive measure can help safeguard against various DoS and DDoS attacks.
